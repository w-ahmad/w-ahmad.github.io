## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Iâ€™m **Waheed Ahmad**, a software developer and open-source enthusiast from Lahore, Pakistan. I love building apps with **.NET, WinUI, and Blazor**, and I truly enjoy turning ideas into polished, working software. Iâ€™m passionate about creating clean, easy-to-use solutions that make life simpler for both end-users and developers.

I actively work on open-source projects like [**WinUI.TableView**](https://github.com/w-ahmad/WinUI.TableView) and [**BlazorWebView.WinUI**](https://github.com/w-ahmad/BlazorWebView.WinUI), and Iâ€™m always exploring new tools, patterns, and technologies. Whether Iâ€™m developing features, experimenting with UI, or helping others in the community, I enjoy learning, improving, and contributing wherever I can.
